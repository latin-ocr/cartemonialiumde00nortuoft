PREFAGE. xi

Nothing is known of the early· governm'ont of -the Nunnery.
'Phe more ancient grants to the *Nuns make no mention of an
Abbess or Prioress. A Charter of Malcolm, Earl of Fife, is
witnessed by J ames, ‘⁶ Prior of 'Northberwick ;”¹ and an officer
of the Convent occurs more than once, who ⁴is styled “ Magister
monialium.”2 The Convent was governed by a Lady Prioress as
early as 1220, when a controversy between the Prioress and
Convent of Northberwick, and the monks of Dunfermelyn, re-
garding the tithes of Atherey and Gornetun, was settled in a
very curicus composition, in which the Abbot of Dunfermline,
and Alice the Sub-Prioress of North Berwick, were required to
depose to the naked truth after their knowledge, superseding
other evidence.3 For a long time afterwards, we have no in-
timation of the name of a Prioress.

In 1386, on the 6th October, Elena de Carric, then PrioreSS,
granted a receipt for the ferm or rent of the Church of Mayboile,
let on lease to Sir Alan of Cathkert.4

Again, a long interval occurs with no mention of a Prioress
by name. On the 4th of October 1463, Mariot Ramsay, the
Prioress, entered into an agreement with the Vicar of her pai-ish
of Kilconquhar, who was to pay the Convent a pension of twelve
merks yearly out of his vicarage.⁵

In 1474, on the soth April, Mariot' Ramsay was dead. She
was succeeded by Elizabeth Forman, a Nun of the Monastery,⁶
who was Prioress on the loth December 1477.⁷
