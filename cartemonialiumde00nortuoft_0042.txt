APPENDIX 11.

This Appendix consiste of extracts from the protocol-book of Bobert Lauder,

a. nota-ry practising in North Berwick and the neighbourhood. It is now in
the possession of the Burgh of North Berwick.

*ff* The early connexion of the Douglases with North Berwick is shown
by the Charter of Earl Wiuiam, (No. 25.) A small Seal-stamp of brnss,
which must have belonged to him before he was Earl, is now in the possession
of the family of North Berwick; and the family account is, that it was
“ found in 1788, under the east end of the old Church of North Berwick‚ near
the ruins of the Family vault of the Douglases. The vault was destroyed by
a violent storm in 1774, and several stone coffins thrown down.” The Seal
gives a shield of arms, a fess between three mullets in chief, and a heart in
base; with the legend—-

† SIGILLVM . WILLELMI . nm . nn . nonnus.

While the last of these sheets was passing through the press, a Chai-ter was
found among the title—deeds of North Berwick, which is abridged on the

opposite page. The arms on the seal sufficiently asoertain the gunter to have
been James the second EaLrL who fell at Otterbnrne in 1388.
