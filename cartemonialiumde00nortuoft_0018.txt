of the Bishops of Dunblane, with their Culdees for wstnesses,1
and that of Edward de Lastalric, with his unaccountable seal‚2
are scarcely less interesting.

The Monastery of Cistercian Nuns of Saint Mary of North
Berwick‚ is said by Sibbald, (whom Spottiswood follows‚) to have
been founded by MaIcolm, Earl of Fife, in the year 1216.³ These
Charters show, that it was in existence, and pretty ricbly en-
dowed, at least two generations earlier,4 The father and grand-
father of Earl Malcolm‚ are among its benefactors3 and the family
of Carrio, with their vassals de Scalebroc had bestowed upon the
Nuns a revenue out of Barrebeth, and the Church of West Kil-
bride, before the end of the leth century.

Whether the original founders or not, the Earls of Fife were
the Patrons of the Priory‚⁵ and apparently its chief benefactors.
The Nuns owed to their munificence the Parish Church of Saint
Andrew of North Berwick‚ the Churches of Kilconquhar, Largo,
and Logy, two Hospitals endowed for the reception of the poor
and of pilgrimS, at the two ports of the wide ferry—Earlsferry and
North Berwick; and several estates of land, including the beau-
tiful bank of Airthry‚ and “ the land called Gillecalmestun, on
which the Nunnery was built.'’

The Church of Maybole was the gift of the Earls of Carric,
who, apparently, took a peculiar interest in the affairs of the
Gonvent. These benefactions, and that connexion, may perhaps
warrant a conjecture that the first Prioress of the Nunnery whose
name we learn, was descended of the ancient Earls of Carric.
