PREFAOE. . xiii

, When Isabella Hume resigned the Priory, she had retained a
pensiom or annuity of 500 merks, out of its fruitS. This she
assigned to her successor, Dame Margaret, on the 3d of December
1554. She continued to live in the Abbey, and ‘⁶ the said Deym
Margret oblist hyr to gyff the said Deym Isobell ane honest and
sufficiant ordinall ganand to hyr facultye.’'1 Α ⁴

On March 30th 1562, Dame Margaret the Prioress was “ sick
and euil at ease ;'’ and on the eoth of April she was dead.2

Although the property of the Monastery was now alienated‚
or rapidly secularizing, the Convent still continued to linger on,
under the government of another Dame Margaret Hume, who,
on the 9th of J uly 1580, granted a tack to ‘⁶ Maister Alexander
Wod of the Grange‚’' of the teind sheaves of the lands of Lath-
allan and N ewtoun‚ to which was appended ‘⁶ the commoun seill
of the Chaptour;” and this titular Prioress subscribed her own
name ‘⁶ Dem Mergret Hoom,’' while the only two nuns of the
Convent concurring, ‘⁶ Dam Isobell Rentoun,'' and ‘⁶ Dam Mar-
garet Donaldsoun,” touched the pen while their names were set
down by Mr. Robert Lauder the notary.3 In the year 1595,
Margaret Donaldsone was the only nun of the Convent remaining
alive, and in 1596 she concurred with the Prioress in the last
acts for the dissolution of the Monastery.

It is plain that, as in other cases, a succession of persons were
placed in the Priory, with the title of Prioress‚ merely to enable
the family who had now acquired the property of the Convent to
make up titles and exercise the rights of proprietors more eon-
