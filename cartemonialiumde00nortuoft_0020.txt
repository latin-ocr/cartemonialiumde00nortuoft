xii PREFAOE.

Another long blank occurs in the succession of PrioresseS. On
the soth day of September 1523, ‘⁶ Alison Home be the permis-
sioun of God, Priorass of the Abbay of the Nunre ef Northberwik
and Convent of the samyn, chaptourlie gaderit,” let to Alexander
Home of Polwart and Patrick Home his sone and appeirand heir,
the teinds of the kirk of Logy for 19 years, for 90 merks, being 40
merks more than is contained in the Abbey rental therefore; and
appended the common seal of their chapter to the deed.1 On the
4th of J anuary 1524, we find Alison Hume, within the Chapel of
St. John the Baptist, in the Church of the Monastery, resigning
the Priory in favour of Isabel Hume, a Nun of Eecles.2 “ Darne
Isobell Hoym'’ was still Prioress, when, on the 3d of March 1539,
she confessed her inability to write by subscribing a Charter along
with seventeen nuns of her Convent, each having her hand upon
the pen of the notary.3

On the leth August 1544, while Isabella was still styled
Prioress, Dame Margaret Hume, a sister of Patrick Hume of
Polwarth‚ was Postulate, or Prioress eleet; and they both, by the
assistance of a notary, subscribed a Charter, along with twenty
nuns of their house.4

The Priory had now become a family benefice of the family of
Polwarth. On the 24th June 1548, Margaret, now styled Prior-
ess, 'in consideration of §2000 received for the repair and re-
building of the Monastery, granted to her brother, Alexander
Hume, the Convent’s demesne lands of Heuch‚ extending to 234
husband lands, with the North Meadow and the Law.⁵
